# Fractional Regulatory & Quality leadership for early-stage medtech teams

Helping founders navigate FDA, TGA, and EU MDR with clarity, speed, and credibility.

---

### What I do

- Fractional Head of RA/QA for Seed–Series B medtech companies  
- FDA 510(k), PMA, and clinical strategy leadership  
- Lean, investor-ready QMS builds (ISO 13485 / QMSR)

### Who we help

Physician-inventors, technical founders, and early teams building regulated medical devices who need senior regulatory judgment — without hiring full-time too early.

### Why Saunee

Led global regulatory strategy for implantable and diagnostic devices across the US, EU, and APAC. Trusted by founders, engineers, and investors to make the hard calls early.

### About the founder

The firm is led by a global regulatory and quality executive with over a decade of experience bringing complex medical devices to market.

They have led FDA, TGA, and EU MDR programs for implantable, diagnostic, and digital health technologies, working at the intersection of engineering, clinical, and commercial teams. Their work has supported venture-backed startups as well as publicly listed medtech companies.

Before founding Saunee, the team held senior regulatory roles at companies building Class III implantable systems and global diagnostics platforms — where execution quality, not just regulatory theory, determined success.

### How we work

Saunee partners closely with founders and technical teams to remove regulatory uncertainty as early as possible.

Our engagements typically follow a simple, disciplined rhythm:

- **Assess** — Rapidly understand your product, clinical pathway, and regulatory exposure  
- **Design** — Define the fastest credible route through FDA, TGA, or EU MDR  
- **Build** — Create the right documentation, QMS, and evidence as you execute  
- **Support** — Stay engaged through submissions, audits, and investor diligence  

This keeps teams moving quickly while maintaining the level of rigor regulators and investors expect.


Saunee exists to give founders the same level of regulatory clarity that large medtech companies take for granted — without the overhead.
